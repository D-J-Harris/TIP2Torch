# TIP2Torch

Repository forked from [lmoroney/dlaicourse](https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse), following the [TensorFlow in Practice Coursera Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) (TIP).

In addition, I mirror the exercises in PyTorch (2Torch), which allows me to learn both frameworks simultaneously and better appreciate the pros and cons of each in practice. I do this using the open source, style-guide framework [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).
